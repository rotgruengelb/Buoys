Adds dyeable Buoy Blocks that can be placed in water.
All buoy blocks can be placed directly inside water without needing a supporting block to place on.

### Buoy
- Double block that has a space on top to place things like lanterns or torches.
- Chain Buoys connect to them.

### Chain Buoy
- A double block as well, but way shorter and smaller.
- Connects to other buoy blocks upon initial placement, both straight and diagonally.
  - Placing a block one block above where the buoy will sit prevents it from connecting to other buoys upon placement (you can break the block afterward).
